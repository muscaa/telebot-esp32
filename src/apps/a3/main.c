#3. Bicycle reservation system

The app user can view the number of bikes available and their type
and reserve a bike. The application user can add bikes by specifying
the type (city, mountain, road, etc.)and location, search for bikes by
type and availability, borrow a bike for a number of hours (10h) and
return the borrowed bike. Use the file manipulation mechanism to retrieve/save
data from/to the file. Also use data structures for information read from the file.
