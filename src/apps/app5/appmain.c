/*
#5. Train wagons tracking system

Define a data structure whose attributes are the identifier of a train wagon, the type of wagon
(cereals, oil...) and a pointer to the next wagon that will be part of a train (ex. struct wagon {
char *identifier, *type; struct wagon *next; }).
Create a program that allows the following operations:

(a) display of all the wagons that make up the train
(b) count how many wagons of type x there are
(c) adding a wagon to the front of the train
(d) adding a wagon to the back of the train
(e) removing a wagon from the front of the train
(f) removing a wagon from the back of the train
